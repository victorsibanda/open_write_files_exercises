# Taks 1
I want a program to ask for food. 
As a user I should be able to ask for any amount of food.#
As I user I should be able to create different orders (different files)
As a user I should be able to read back the order to my client
**Acceptance criterea** 
- it should be well formated
- it should be numbered
example 
```python
> 1 - Nachos
> 2 - Diet CocaCola
``` 
As a user, if I try to read a order that doens't exist it should give me an error. 
As a user I should be able to amend my order :) 
## DOD 
- is its own project
- git and github 
- simple documentation
- functional
- separation of concerns
- it should handle errors
